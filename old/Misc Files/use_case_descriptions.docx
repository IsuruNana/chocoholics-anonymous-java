5.	The system ejects the card.
6.	The provider passes the member card again through the scanner or enters the member’s 9-digit PIN (simulated via keyboard input).
7.	The system validates the member.
8.	After validation, the healthcare provider enters the date of the service according to the format “MM-DD-YYYY” to ensure that the system records all transactions in the event of some unforeseen problem occurring.
9.	Provider searches for the correct 6-digit service code by accessing the Provider Directory, based on the service.
10.	Provider enters the service code into the terminal (simulated via keyboard input).
11.	The system prints the service name based on the code (up to 20 characters simulated via screen) to the provider’s terminal.
12.	The system asks the provider to confirm that the service is correct (simulated via screen).
13.	The provider confirms the selection and enters any additional comments about the service (simulated via keyboard input).

Use Case: Validation
Context: The member or provider must interact with the provider terminal and be validated.
Actors: Member or Provider and ChocAn Data Center Computer
Main Success Scenario:
1.	When the provider terminal reads a card or PIN, it dials the ChocAn Data Center.
2.	The ChocAn Data Center Computer verifies the member’s PIN.
2.1.  The ChocAn Data Center Computer communicates with the provider terminal to
 print the word “Validated” on the terminal’s one-line display.
Extensions:

		1a.1.  The system informs the provider and member (simulated via screen) as to
the reason for an invalid entry by printing a message such as
“Invalid number,” “Member suspended,” etc.  These correspond to 
an invalid member number or ChocAn suspending the client’s membership status due to their not paying membership fees for a month or more.
